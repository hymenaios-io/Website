### What is Argus?

[Argus](https://github.com/release-argus/Argus) is an open-source monitor for new software releases, be that through GitHub release tracking, or website change detection (through RegEx).

### Why do I want it?

- To keep track of new releases of one or more pieces of (most likely open-source) software.

- To be notified of these new releases via:
  - Discord
  - Email
  - Gotify
  - Google Chat
  - IFTTT
  - Join
  - Mattermost
  - Matrix
  - OpsGenie
  - Pushbullet
  - Pushover
  - Rocket.Chat
  - Slack
  - Teams
  - Telegram
  - Zulip

- To be able to send WebHook(s) to services in order to trigger the upgrade. (e.g. an AWX server with PlayBooks that will deploy the latest version, thanks to [awx-operator](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator))

- To have a nice* web UI that displays all this tracking (see the [demo](/demo/approvals)).
