## Help finding ID
You can go through your `config.yml` and find what ID you defined in the service/gotify/slack mapping, or you could give an undefined ID to this flag.

e.g.
```bash
❯ ./hymenaios -test.service a
Loading config from "config.yml"
INFO: Testing (a)
ERROR: Testing (a), Service "a" could not be found in config.service
Did you mean one of these?
  - EXAMPLE_1
  - EXAMPLE_2
  - EXAMPLE_3
```
