Argus (named after the hundred-eyed giant in Greek mythology) was developed to help me stay on the latest releases.
Rather than scheduling AWX jobs every week for instance, there was a desire to have them run only when there is a change
to be made. So, Argus was developed to solve this want. It alerts and actions the new releases, all while providing a UI
to see what it's tracking.
